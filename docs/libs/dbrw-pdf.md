Abstract—Cloning attacks represent a significant threat to
mobile applications, particularly those handling sensitive data
or financial transactions. Current anti-cloning solutions typi-
cally rely on hardware binding or environmental detection, but
not both, creating exploitable security gaps. We introduce the
Dual-Binding Random Walk (DBRW) algorithm, a novel anti-
cloning approach that integrates hardware-derived entropy with
execution environment fingerprinting through a dual-binding
mechanism that establishes cryptographic inseparability between
physical and contextual identifiers. DBRW leverages memory
timing characteristics to extract device-specific entropy and
combines it with application environment parameters to de-
tect both cross-device and same-device container-based cloning.
We integrate DBRW into the Decentralized State Machine
(DSM) framework and demonstrate its efficacy in preventing
state migration attacks. Experimental results show that DBRW
achieves 99.7% accuracy in detecting cloned applications while
maintaining a false positive rate below 0.5%, even in resource-
constrained mobile environments.

I. INTRODUCTION
Mobile application cloning has emerged as a critical secu-
rity challenge, particularly for financial, cryptocurrency, and
identity-management applications. Cloning attacks typically
fall into two categories: cross-device cloning, where applica-
tion state is migrated to a different physical device, and same-
device container-based cloning, where applications are dupli-
cated within isolated environments on a single physical device.
Traditional anti-cloning solutions focus on either hardware-
based device fingerprinting or environment detection, but
rarely both.
This paper introduces the Dual-Binding Random Walk
(DBRW) algorithm, a novel approach that creates crypto-
graphic inseparability between physical device characteris-
tics and execution environment contexts. DBRW combines
hardware-derived entropy from memory timing characteristics
with environmental fingerprinting to create a dual binding that
detects both forms of cloning with high accuracy.
The main contributions of this paper are:

- A novel dual-binding mechanism that establishes crypto-
  graphic inseparability between hardware and environment
  characteristics
- A random walk-based hardware entropy extraction
  method optimized for resource-constrained mobile envi-
  ronments
- A forward-only commitment chain mechanism that pre-
  vents state rollback attacks
- Integration of DBRW into the Decentralized State Ma-
  chine (DSM) framework - Experimental validation demonstrating high accuracy in
  detecting both cross-device and container-based cloning

II. BACKGROUND ANDRELATEDWORK
A. Device Fingerprinting
Device fingerprinting techniques aim to uniquely identify
hardware using characteristics that are difficult to replicate.
Bojinov et al. [1] demonstrated that sensor calibration data
could fingerprint mobile devices. Das et al. [2] explored using
memory access patterns for device identification. However,
these approaches focus primarily on cross-device cloning and
are ineffective against container-based attacks.
```

```
B. Environment Detection
Environment detection techniques identify virtualized or
containerized environments. Petsas et al. [3] developed meth-
ods to detect Android emulators. Colp et al. [4] presented
techniques for identifying containerized environments. These
approaches, while effective against same-device cloning, fail
to address cross-device cloning when hardware characteristics
are not considered.
```

```
C. Decentralized State Machine (DSM)
DSM is a framework for secure distributed applications that
uses state transition systems with cryptographic protections.
DSM applications maintain application state as a series of
transitions with signatures, making state migration a security-
critical operation that requires protection against unauthorized
cloning.
```

```
III. THREATMODEL
We consider adversaries attempting two types of application
cloning:
```

- Cross-device cloning: Extracting application state from
  one device and recreating it on a physically different
  device.
- Container-based cloning: Duplicating an application
  within isolated environments (containers, VMs, etc.) on
  the same physical device.
  We assume the adversary has full control over the target
  device’s software environment, including the ability to modify
  the operating system, but does not have the capability to pre-
  cisely replicate hardware timing characteristics across different
  physical devices.

##### IV. DBRW: SYSTEMDESIGN

A. Theoretical Foundation

We begin by formalizing the dual-binding problem and
establishing its theoretical properties.

Definition 1 (Hardware Entropy). Let H represent a
hardware-specific entropy function that maps a devicedto
a bit string:H :D → { 0 , 1 }n, whereDis the set of all
devices andnis the entropy length.

Definition 2(Environment Fingerprint). LetE represent an
environment fingerprinting function that maps an execution
environmenteto a bit string:E :E\⊑ → { 0 , 1 }m, where
E\⊑is the set of all possible execution environments andm
is the fingerprint length.

Definition 3(Dual-Binding).A dual-binding functionBcom-
bines hardware entropy and environment fingerprints:B :
{ 0 , 1 }n× { 0 , 1 }m → { 0 , 1 }k, wherek is the binding key
length.

Theorem 1(Binding Inseparability).IfBis constructed using
a cryptographic hash functionHasB(h, e) =H(h∥e), then
given onlyB(h, e), it is computationally infeasible to findh′
ande′such thatB(h′, e′) =B(h, e)and eitherh′ ̸=hor
e′̸=e.

Proof.Assume that givenb = B(h, e) = H(h ∥ e), an
adversary can findh′ ande′such thatH(h′∥e′) =band
eitherh′̸=hore′̸=e.
This implies the adversary can find a collision forH,
contradicting the collision resistance property of cryptographic
hash functions. Therefore, it is computationally infeasible to
find suchh′ande′.

Lemma 2(Cross-Device Detection).Let devicesd 1 andd 2 be
distinct physical devices. Then with high probability,H(d 1 )̸=
H(d 2 )and consequentlyB(H(d 1 ), e)̸=B(H(d 2 ), e)for any
environmente.

Proof.The hardware entropy function H extracts timing
characteristics of memory access patterns that are influenced
by physical hardware variations. These variations exist even
among devices of identical make and model due to manufac-
turing differences.
LetX 1 , X 2 ,... , Xnbe the random variables representing
timing measurements on deviced 1 , and letY 1 , Y 2 ,... , Ynbe
the corresponding measurements on deviced 2.
EachXiandYifollows a distribution with device-specific
parameters. The probability that all measurements are identical
across devices is:

```
P(∀i:Xi=Yi) =
```

```
Yn
```

```
i=
```

```
P(Xi=Yi) (1)
```

Since each measurement is independent and influenced by
hardware-specific variations,P(Xi = Yi) < 1 , and thus
P(∀i:Xi=Yi)≈ 0 for sufficiently largen.

```
Therefore, with high probability,H(d 1 )̸=H(d 2 ), and due
to the collision resistance ofB,B(H(d 1 ), e)̸=B(H(d 2 ), e).
```

```
Lemma 3(Container Detection). Lete 1 ande 2 be distinct
execution environments on the same deviced. ThenE(e 1 )̸=
E(e 2 )and consequentlyB(H(d),E(e 1 ))̸=B(H(d),E(e 2 )).
Proof.The environment fingerprinting functionE captures
properties such as installation path, data directory, and storage
volume identifiers. Different execution environments (contain-
ers, VMs, etc.) will have different values for these properties
by design.
LetP 1 , P 2 ,... , Pmbe the environmental parameters cap-
tured for environment e 1 , and let Q 1 , Q 2 ,... , Qm be the
corresponding parameters for environmente 2.
By the definition of distinct execution environments, there
exists at least one parameterjsuch thatPj̸=Qj. Therefore,
E(e 1 )̸=E(e 2 ).
Due to the collision resistance of B, it follows that
B(H(d),E(e 1 ))̸=B(H(d),E(e 2 )).
Theorem 4 (Forward-Only Commitment). Let Ci =
H(Ci− 1 ∥K∥Ti∥Ni∥i)be a commitment chain, where
Kis the binding key,Tiis a timestamp,Niis a nonce, andi
is the chain index. GivenCi, it is computationally infeasible
to computeCi+1without knowledge ofK.
Proof.To computeCi+1, one needs:
Ci+1=H(Ci∥K∥Ti+1∥Ni+1∥(i+ 1)) (2)
While Ci, Ti+1, Ni+1, and (i+ 1) may be known or
computable,K is the binding key derived from hardware
entropy and environment fingerprint. By Theorem 1 (Binding
Inseparability), it is computationally infeasible to determine
K without knowledge of both the hardware entropy and
environment fingerprint.
Therefore, withoutK, computingCi+1would require find-
ing a preimage forH, which contradicts the preimage resis-
tance property of cryptographic hash functions.
B. System Architecture
DBRW consists of four primary components:
1) RandomWalkMemoryInterrogation: Extracts
hardware-derived entropy through memory timing
measurements
2) EnvironmentFingerprinting: Collects execution envi-
ronment characteristics
3) DualBindingKeyDerivation: Combines hardware en-
tropy and environment fingerprints to create a binding
key
4) ForwardOnlyCommitmentChain: Maintains a tempo-
ral chain of commitments to prevent state rollback
```

Figure 1 illustrates the DBRW architecture and its integra-
tion with the DSM framework.
```

C. Hardware Entropy Extraction

DBRW extracts hardware entropy by performing a deter-
ministic random walk through memory and measuring access
timing characteristics. The random walk pattern is carefully
designed to be:

- Deterministic: The same sequence of memory addresses
  is accessed each time
- Diverse: The access pattern covers different memory
  regions
- Timing-sensitive: The measurements focus on timing
  variations influenced by hardware characteristics

```
Algorithm 1:RandomWalkMemoryInterrogation
Initialize memory block with random data;
Generate walk addresses using deterministic seed;
Perform warm-up iterations;
foreach address in walk addressesdo
Flush CPU cache;
Start timer;
Perform memory access;
End timer;
Record timing difference;
end
Process timing measurements into fingerprint;
returnHardware fingerprint;
```

D. Environment Fingerprinting

DBRW captures environment-specific parameters that differ
across containers or virtual environments but remain constant
within the same execution context:

- Installation path hash
- Installation time
- Application data directory information
- Package name and UID combination
- Storage volume UUID

E. Dual-Binding Mechanism

The dual-binding mechanism combines hardware entropy
and environment fingerprints using an HMAC-based key
derivation function:

```
Algorithm 2:DualBindingKeyDerivation
Quantize hardware entropy for stability;
Use environment fingerprint as HMAC salt;
Derive binding key:
K=HMAC(salt,hardwareentropy);
returnBinding key;
```

F. Forward-Only Commitment Chain

DBRW maintains a forward-only commitment chain to
prevent state rollback attacks:

```
Algorithm 3:ForwardOnlyCommitmentChain
Initialize:C 0 =H(K∥deviceInfo);
Set timestampT 0 and indexi= 0;
Generate initial nonceN 0 ;
StoreC 0 ,T 0 ,N 0 , andi;
ProcedureExtend(K)
i=i+ 1;
Generate new timestampTiand nonceNi;
Ci=H(Ci− 1 ∥K∥Ti∥Ni∥i);
StoreCi,Ti,Ni, andi;
returntrue;
end
ProcedureVerify(K)
Verify current time is not earlier than stored
timestamp;
Compute verification tag usingK;
Check tag against stored commitment;
returnresult;
end
```

##### V. IMPLEMENTATION INDSM FRAMEWORK

(DSM) framework, implementing the algorithm across multi-
ple programming languages to support its layered architecture:

C. JNI Bridge for Native Integration
To bridge between Java and native code, we implemented
a JNI connector:

VI. EVALUATION

performance, reliability, and security.
A. Effectiveness in Detecting Clones
We tested DBRW against both cross-device and container-
based cloning scenarios:
```

```
TABLE I
CLONEDETECTIONACCURACY
Scenario Detection Rate False Positives
Cross-Device Cloning 99.8% 0.3%
Container-Based Cloning 100% 0.2%
Combined Scenarios 99.7% 0.4%
```

```
B. Performance Impact
We measured the performance overhead of DBRW on
mobile application startup and during runtime:
```

```
TABLE II

Metric Average Overhead
Application Startup Time +142ms (5.7%)
Memory Usage +1.8MB (2.3%)
CPU Usage (Background) +0.2%
Battery Impact (Daily) +0.3%
```

```

assess its reliability:
```

```
TABLE III
CROSS-DEVICERELIABILITY
```

```
Device Category Hardware Recognition False Rejections
High-end (8+ cores) 99.9% 0.1%

State Extraction High
State Rollback Very High
```

##### VII. DISCUSSION

A. Advantages of Dual-Binding Approach

The combination of hardware-derived entropy and environ-
ment fingerprinting provides superior protection compared to
either approach alone. Hardware binding ensures that even
perfect replication of the software environment on a different
physical device will fail validation. Environment fingerprinting
ensures that even on the same physical device, containerized
instances will be detected.

B. Error Tolerance for Hardware Variations

DBRW implements an error tolerance mechanism for hard-
ware fingerprinting that accommodates slight variations in
timing measurements while still detecting significant changes.
This is crucial for practical deployments where minor hard-
ware fluctuations are expected.

C. Forward-Only Commitment Chain

The commitment chain mechanism provides temporal val-
idation that prevents state rollback attacks. This is particu-
larly important for financial applications where the ability to
”rewind” state could enable double-spending.

D. Limitations

```
DBRW has several limitations that should be acknowledged:
```

- Performance variations: On extremely resource-
  constrained devices, timing measurements may be less
  reliable, necessitating more measurement iterations.
- Power management: Aggressive power management can
  affect timing measurements, requiring calibration and
  adjustment.
- Hardware upgrades: Major hardware component re-
  placements may trigger false positives, requiring re-
  initialization.

VIII. CONCLUSION
The Dual-Binding Random Walk (DBRW) algorithm repre-
sents a significant advancement in anti-cloning protection for
mobile applications. By creating cryptographic inseparability
between hardware characteristics and execution environment
context, DBRW detects both cross-device and container-based
cloning attacks with high accuracy. Its integration with the

```
DSM framework enhances the security of identity management
and financial operations in distributed systems.
Future work will focus on extending DBRW to support
more diverse hardware platforms, improving its resilience
against sophisticated timing analysis attacks, and developing
techniques to distinguish between legitimate device upgrades
and cloning attempts.

Cloning Scenario
```

```
Binding Function:B(h, e) =H(h∥e)
Inseparability Property:GivenB(h, e), findingh′ande′such that
B(h′, e′) =B(h, e) whereh′̸=hore′̸=eis computationally infeasible.
```

```
MissingK

```
×Cannot generateC 1 withoutK
Forward-Only Commitment Formula:
Ci=H(Ci− 1 ∥K∥Ti∥Ni∥i)
```

```
Security Property:Without knowledge of the binding
keyK, an attacker cannot generate valid future commit-
ment states, even with knowledge of previous commitments.
This prevents both state cloning and state rollback attacks.

## Random Walk Memory Interrogation Process

```
Note:Hardware-specific entropy is de-
rived from timing variations caused by
physical differences in memory architec-
ture, manufacturing process variances,
and cache/memory controller characteristics unique to each device.

### Memory Timing Measurements: Raw vs. Quantized

```
Raw Timing Data
Quantized Data (10 ns bins)
```

```
Bin 4: 165–175 ns
Bin 3: 155–165 ns
Bin 2: 145–155 ns
Bin 1: 135–145 ns
```

```
Quantization Process for Stable Hardware Entropy
Memory timing measurements naturally fluctu-
ate due to temperature, CPU load, and other factors.
To create a stable hardware entropy source, raw tim-
ing measurements are quantized into discrete bins
that preserve the device’s unique timing signature while minimizing noise-induced variations.
The device-specific pattern is maintained while reducing sensitivity to minor timing changes.
